8. **View Logs**
```
make logs
```
9. **Stay Updated**
```
make pipeline
```
   To keep your project up to date, this command will:
- Install PHP dependencies
- Run migrations and seed the database
### Without Using the Makefile
1. **Copy the ```.env``` File**
```
cp .env.example .env
```
2. **Build and Start the Docker Services**
```
docker compose up -d --build
```
3. **Install Composer Dependencies**
```
docker compose exec app composer install
```
4. **Generate the Application Key**
```
docker compose exec app php artisan key:generate
```
5. **Generate JWT Secret**
```php
docker compose exec app php artisan jwt:secret
```
6. **Run Migrations and Seed the Database**
```
docker compose exec app php artisan migrate --seed
```
6. Run Tests
```
docker compose exec app php artisan test
```
